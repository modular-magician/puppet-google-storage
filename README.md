## Module Description

This Puppet module manages the resource of Google Cloud Storage.
You can manage its resources using standard Puppet DSL and the module will,
under the hood, ensure the state described will be reflected in the Google
Cloud Platform resources.

## Setup

To install this module on your Puppet Master (or Puppet Client/Agent), use the
Puppet module installer:

    puppet module install google-gstorage

Optionally you can install support to _all_ Google Cloud Platform products at
once by installing our "bundle" [`google-cloud`][bundle-forge] module:

    puppet module install google-cloud

## Usage

### Credentials

All Google Cloud Platform modules use an unified authentication mechanism,
provided by the [`google-gauth`][] module. Don't worry, it is automatically
installed when you install this module.

```puppet
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control',
  ],
}
```

Please refer to the [`google-gauth`][] module for further requirements, i.e.
required gems.

### Examples

#### `gstorage_bucket`

```puppet
# This is a simple example of a bucket creation/ensure existence. If you want a
# more thorough setup of its ACL please refer to 'examples/bucket~acl.pp'
# manifest.
gstorage_bucket { 'puppet-storage-module-test':
  ensure     => present,
  project    => 'google.com:graphite-playground',
  credential => 'mycred',
}

```

#### `gstorage_bucket_access_control`

```puppet
# Bucket Access Control requires a bucket. Please ensure its existence with
# the gstorage_bucket { ... } resource
gstorage_bucket_access_control { 'user-nelsona@google.com':
  bucket     => 'puppet-storage-module-test',
  entity     => 'user-nelsona@google.com',
  role       => 'WRITER',
  project    => 'google.com:graphite-playground',
  credential => 'mycred',
}

```


### Classes

#### Public classes

* [`gstorage_bucket`][]:
    The Buckets resource represents a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. There
    is
    a single global namespace shared by all buckets. For more information,
    see
    Bucket Name Requirements.
    Buckets contain objects which can be accessed by their own methods. In
    addition to the acl property, buckets contain bucketAccessControls, for
    use in fine-grained manipulation of an existing bucket's access
    controls.
    A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group.
* [`gstorage_bucket_access_control`][]:
    The BucketAccessControls resource represents the Access Control Lists
    (ACLs) for buckets within Google Cloud Storage. ACLs let you specify
    who
    has access to your data and to what extent.
    There are three roles that can be assigned to an entity:
    READERs can get the bucket, though no acl property will be returned,
    and
    list the bucket's objects.  WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert
    objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects.  OWNERs are
    WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a
    bucket,
    and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket.  For more
    information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses
    READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL.

### About output only properties

Some fields are output-only. It means you cannot set them because they are
provided by the Google Cloud Platform. Yet they are still useful to ensure the
value the API is assigning (or has assigned in the past) is still the value you
expect.

For example in a DNS the name servers are assigned by the Google Cloud DNS
service. Checking these values once created is useful to make sure your upstream
and/or root DNS masters are in sync.  Or if you decide to use the object ID,
e.g. the VM unique ID, for billing purposes. If the VM gets deleted and
recreated it will have a different ID, despite the name being the same. If that
detail is important to you you can verify that the ID of the object did not
change by asserting it in the manifest.

### Parameters

#### `gstorage_bucket`

The Buckets resource represents a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. There is
a single global namespace shared by all buckets. For more information, see
Bucket Name Requirements.

Buckets contain objects which can be accessed by their own methods. In
addition to the acl property, buckets contain bucketAccessControls, for
use in fine-grained manipulation of an existing bucket's access controls.

A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group.


#### Example

```puppet
# This is a simple example of a bucket creation/ensure existence. If you want a
# more thorough setup of its ACL please refer to 'examples/bucket~acl.pp'
# manifest.
gstorage_bucket { 'puppet-storage-module-test':
  ensure     => present,
  project    => 'google.com:graphite-playground',
  credential => 'mycred',
}

```

##### versioning/enabled
  While set to true, versioning is fully enabled for this bucket.

##### `website`

  The bucket's website configuration, controlling how the service
  behaves when accessing bucket contents as a web site. See the Static
  Website Examples for more information.

##### website/main_page_suffix
  If the requested object path is missing, the service will ensure
  the path has a trailing '/', append this suffix, and attempt to
  retrieve the resulting object. This allows the creation of
  index.html objects to represent directory pages.

##### website/not_found_page
  If the requested object path is missing, and any mainPageSuffix
  object is missing, if applicable, the service will return the
  named object from this bucket as the content for a 404 Not Found

* `time_created`: Output only.
  The creation time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format.

* `updated`: Output only.
  The modification time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format.

#### `gstorage_bucket_access_control`

The BucketAccessControls resource represents the Access Control Lists
(ACLs) for buckets within Google Cloud Storage. ACLs let you specify who
has access to your data and to what extent.

There are three roles that can be assigned to an entity:

READERs can get the bucket, though no acl property will be returned, and
list the bucket's objects.  WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert
objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects.  OWNERs are
WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a bucket,
and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket.  For more
information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses
READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL.


#### Example

```puppet
# Bucket Access Control requires a bucket. Please ensure its existence with
# the gstorage_bucket { ... } resource
gstorage_bucket_access_control { 'user-nelsona@google.com':

## Development

### Automatically Generated Files

Some files in this package are automatically generated by
[Magic Modules][magic-modules].

We use a code compiler to produce this module in order to avoid repetitive tasks
and improve code quality. This means all Google Cloud Platform Puppet modules
use the same underlying authentication, logic, test generation, style checks,
etc.
